      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am currently a second-year student at Far Eastern University Institute of Technology, </p>  
      <p>pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering. </p>  
      <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have been developing a strong foundation in programming, </p>  
      <p>data structures, algorithms, database management, and software development principles.</p>  
      <br>
      <p>As an aspiring Full Stack Developer, I am passionate about building efficient, scalable, and </p>  
      <p>user-friendly applications. I enjoy working on both the front-end and back-end aspects of </p>  
      <p>development—designing intuitive user interfaces while also creating robust server-side logic </p>  
      <p>and managing databases. I am continuously improving my skills in modern web technologies and </p>  
      <p>frameworks, and I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge through personal projects, </p>  
      <p>collaborations, and hands-on learning experiences. </p>
      <br>
      <p>My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer who not only writes clean and maintainable</p>  
      <p>code but also understands system design, performance optimization, and user experience. I am </p>  
      <p>motivated to grow in the tech industry, contribute to impactful projects, and continuously adapt to</p>  
      <p>to emerging technologies. </p>
